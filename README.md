Fresh, nightly builds of winget.

Want to see what the latest cool feature is on the [winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) master branch? This repository compiles a daily build for you to use. Stability is not guaranteed, although I can guarantee you won't get support from MS ;)

To use it, download the [latest](https://github.com/damnkiwi6120/winget-build/releases/latest) copy of wingetdev.zip, extract it, and run `wingetdev.exe`! Note that all of the files in that folder have to stay together, so if you have a .bin folder you like to put loose executables in, keep them together.

Or, if you're feeling speedy, just use the quick script inside this repo from PowerShell: `iwr -useb https://github.com/damnkiwi6120/winget-build/raw/main/Install.ps1 | iex`

No dependencies should be necessary outside of the 2015-2019 Visual Studio Redistributables, which you probably have. If you don't have them, just run `winget install -s winget Microsoft.VC++2015-2019Redist-x64`.
